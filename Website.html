                <h1 id="name">Hey, this is Janelle!</h1>
                <p>I'm currently a 2nd year UWA student for Bachelor of Advanced Computer Science, majoring in Artificial Intelligence.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ever since I was young, I have had a passion for coding and working out how things work. 
                    I started off playing around with Unity around Year 5, and managed to teach myself very basic coding with C#, such as how to print 'Hello World'.
                    Outside of coding, I partake in other hobbies such as digital art, playing the piano and crocheting.
